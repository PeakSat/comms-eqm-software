     * A basic driver for the CAN Peripherals of the ?? family of processors. This driver includes encoding/decoding
     * functions for the Data Length Code as well as the ID when used in normal addressing mode. There are two interrupt
     * callback functions, one for registering a transmission plus logging an error if needed, and one for passing the
     * incoming CAN::Frames to the higher level services in the application. This driver handles both peripherals,
     * while keeping only one active through a parameter for transmission, and disabling interrupts for receipt.
     *
     * @note CAN Normal Addressing requires the NodeID to be at most 11 bits long.
     *
     * @note There are two peripherals for the CAN Bus. The main bus is considered as MCAN1, since that is the one
     * available on the development board.
     *
     * @example @code
     * uint32_t id = 0x4; // Specify the sending Node ID.
     * etl::vector<uint8_t, 8> data = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}; // Specify an array of data, up to 64 bytes.
     * CAN::Frame message = {id, data}; // Create a CAN::Frame object.
     * CAN::Driver::send(message, Application::Main); // Use the included send function to send a message on the Main bus.
     * @endcode
